# Contributing

Thank you for choosing to contribute to HCB Mobile! Please follow the guidelines before on how to contribute.

- Use the PR template
- Preferably, prefix your branch names with your name. e.g. `garyhtou/branch-name`
- Update your branch by merging `main` into your feature branch rather than rebasing. Rebasing will create new commits causing review comments to shift out of order.
- When merging PRs into main, squash and rebase

All contributors are expected to follow the Hack Club [Code of Conduct](https://hackclub.com/conduct) and Hack Club's [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/hackclub/hackclub/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Join the [#hcb-mobile](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C04CW5HNGR5) channel on the [Hack Club Slack](https://hackclub.com/slack) for support.
