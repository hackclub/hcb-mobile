## Setup

HCB Mobile connects to HCB throught the v4 API.
You can either connect to the production HCB instance, or a local development instance.

### Production HCB

Set your `.env` to include the following variables:

```
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE=https://hcb.hackclub.com/api/v4
EXPO_PUBLIC_CLIENT_ID=yt8JHmPDmmYYLUmoEiGtocYwg5fSOGCrcIY3G-vkMRs
EXPO_PUBLIC_STRIPE_API_KEY=pk_live_UAjIP1Kss29XZ6tW0MFWkjUQ
```

### Development HCB

Go into the Rails console on your development server (`bin/rails c`), and run the following:

```
app = Doorkeeper::Application.create(name: "mobile", redirect_uri: "hcb://", scopes: ["read", "write"], confidential: false)
```

Then, set your `.env` to include the following variables:

```
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_BASE=http://<host>/api/v4
EXPO_PUBLIC_CLIENT_ID=<uid field from the Doorkeeper app>
```
