## What is HCB?

HCB is an [open source](https://hackclub.com/fiscal-sponsorship/open-source/),
safe, and easy-to-use fiscal sponsorship platform for hackathons, Hack Clubs,
robotic teams and more. We use it to run
our [fiscal sponsorship program](https://hackclub.com/fiscal-sponsorship/), we
provide high schoolers with a 501(c)(3) status-backed restricted fund for their
organization.

## Features

**HCB Mobile** brings the full power of HCB right to your pocket. You can:

- Track your organizations—stay up to date with your organization activity straight for your phone.

- Manage your cards—now you can add your cards directly to your Apple / Google Wallet directly from the app (no more manually entering in card details). Need a new card on the go? Issue a new card right from your phone! Card got lost while shopping? Freeze it with just a tap.

- Upload receipts the easy way—we all know receipt tracking is painful, so we built it directly into the app! Upload photos directly from your device, share them from other apps, or match existing receipts to transactions with a tap.

- Accept Tap to Pay donations—accept contactless payments directly on your mobile device. No extra hardware required.

## Quick start

To run HCB Mobile in a development environment, follow the setup instructions in
our [documentation](/dev-docs/development.md). We provide setup instructions for running the app both on Android Simulators [(Android Studio)](https://developer.android.com/studio) and on iOS Simulators [(Xcode)](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
